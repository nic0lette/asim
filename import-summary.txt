Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/androidannotations-api-3.1.jar => app/libs/androidannotations-api-3.1.jar
* libs/core-1.51.0.0.jar => app/libs/core-1.51.0.0.jar
* libs/jxmpp-core-0.4.0.jar => app/libs/jxmpp-core-0.4.0.jar
* libs/jxmpp-util-cache-0.4.0.jar => app/libs/jxmpp-util-cache-0.4.0.jar
* libs/minidns-0.1.3.jar => app/libs/minidns-0.1.3.jar
* libs/otr4j-0.21.jar => app/libs/otr4j-0.21.jar
* libs/smack-android-4.1.0-alpha5.jar => app/libs/smack-android-4.1.0-alpha5.jar
* libs/smack-core-4.1.0-alpha5.jar => app/libs/smack-core-4.1.0-alpha5.jar
* libs/smack-extensions-4.1.0-alpha5.jar => app/libs/smack-extensions-4.1.0-alpha5.jar
* libs/smack-resolver-minidns-4.1.0-alpha5.jar => app/libs/smack-resolver-minidns-4.1.0-alpha5.jar
* libs/smack-tcp-4.1.0-alpha5.jar => app/libs/smack-tcp-4.1.0-alpha5.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
